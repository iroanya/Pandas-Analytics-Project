# Pandas-Analytics-Project

The purpose of this project is to analyze data from three different branches of a supermaket chain in Lagos, Abuja and Port Harcourt.

# Project Steps

1.  Was to import all the required libraries. 

2. Collate necessary data from the web.

3. Combine the collated data into one dataframe, Supermarkets_Data.

4. Create another dataframe with the categorical columns.

5. Then use the df.head() to ensure that the new dataframes created are up and running. 

6. Use the .shape() function to understand the rows and column numbers contained in the dataframe and use the column_name to call the column names.
   
# Data Exploration

1. Using the .head() to view the first view rows

2. After preparing and cleaning the data, the next step was to plot a summary of the dataframe named Supermarkets_Data.

3. Check the number of rows and columns present.

4. Generate the column names.

5. Check for missing data and values.

6. Use the .info() method to check the data.

# Insights

1. Using the .describe() function, it is easy to see the value differences for the various product resulted in a high standard deviation values.
2. There are no missing values in the dataframe.
3. Using unique values and count, I was able to establish that there are not much statistical difference in the members and normal customers that patronized the shops. That the payment methods are equally spread.
4. The branches varied in the product lines that sold the most. Lagos (Home and Lifestyle), Port harcourt (Food and Beverages) and Abuja (Sports and Travel). On the whole, Port Harcourt had more product lines in the top five of gross sales. Abuja performed poorly registering its highest selling product line in the number six position.
5. The highest grossing product line across all branches is the food and beverages product line.
6. Port Harcourt registered the highest gross income followed by Lagos and Abuja. However, Lagos sold more products overall.
7. Lagos and PortHarcourt recorded more sales in month one while Abuja sold more in month two.
8. The highest ratings were recorded in the Abuja branch and the highest rated items were in the sports and travel product line.
9. 6.0 was the rating given by highest number of customers while 10 was given by the least number of customers.

# Future Work

In the future I will like to have a breakdown of the product lines so as to find which products excelled and which ones did not. There is a need to include the stock inventory with the data so it will be easy to analyse if sales is affected by the inventory position.

# Standout Section

I looked closely at the data provided and discovered that there is not much statistical differences in most of the columns. However, it is important to note that upon review of the ratings section, something appears to be outstanding.
1. 60% of the highest rating point of 10 were from normal customers and 80% of them were female.
2. 64% of the lowest ratings were from members and 55% were female.
3. Observed that month one is the highest performing month for Branch A and C, while the Branch B excelled in month two.

The question arises, why are more members disatisfied with items purchased from the stores? And why are the normal shoppers happy with the items? Again why do some stores perform better in certain months. A study should be conducted to find out why this is so.

# Executive Summary.

The data provided shows that the stores and the locations are about per in sales performance and income earned. The questions asked will center on ways to improve the performance of each store. We would recommend that each store include addresses of the customers and inventory positions per day to help monitor if the sales of certain items were infuenced by the stock balances. I would also advice the store managers to send out questionnaires to the members with a view to identifying the grievances they have and address them positively. The happier the members are, the more references they will get.
