# Pandas-Analytics-Project

The purpose of this project is to analyze data from three different brances of a supermaket chain.

# Project Steps

1.  Was to import all the required all the libraries and collate the data from the three different locations into one dataframe (df3).
Then use the df.head() to ensure that the new dataframe created is up and running. 
 2. Use the .shape() function to understand the rows and column numbers contained in the dataframe and the call column_name. 

# Insights

1. Using the .describe() function, it is easy to see the value differences for the various product resulted in a high standard deviation values.
2. There are no missing values in the dataframe.
3. Using unique values and count, I was able to establish that there are not much statistical diffrence in the members and normal customers that patronized the shops. That the payment methods are equally spread.
4. The branches varied in the product lines that sold the most. Lagos (Home and Lifestyle), Port harcourt (Food and Beverages) and Abuja (Sports and Travel). On the whole, Port Harcourt had more product lines in the top five of gross sales. Abuja performed poorly registering its highest saling product line in the number six position.
5. The highest grossing product line across all branches is the food and beverages product line.
6. Port Harcourt registered the highest gross income followed by Lagos and Abuja. However, Lagos sold more products overall.
7. Lagos and PortHarcourt recorded more sales in month one while Abuja sold more in month two.

# Future Work

In the future I will like to have a breakdown of the product lines so as to find which products excelled and which ones did not.

# Standout Section

I lokked closely at the data provided and discovered that there is not much statistical differences in most of the columns.
