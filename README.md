# Pandas-Analytics-Project

The purpose of this project is to analyze data from three different brances of a supermaket chain.

# Project Steps

1.  Was to import all the required all the libraries and collate the data from the three different locations into one dataframe (df3).
Then use the df.head() to ensure that the new dataframe created is up and running. 
 2. Use the .shape() function to understand the rows and column numbers contained in the dataframe and the call column_name. 

# Insights

1. Using the .describe() function, it is easy to see the value differences for the various product resulted in a high standard deviation values.
2. There are no missing values in the dataframe.
3. Using unique values and count, I was able to establish that there are not much statistical diffrence in the members and normal customers that patronized the shops. That the payment methods are equally spread.
4. The branches varied in the product lines that sold the most. Lagos (Home and Lifestyle), Port harcourt (Food and Beverages) and Abuja (Sports and Travel). On the whole, Port Harcourt had more product lines in the top five of gross sales. Abuja performed poorly registering its highest saling product line in the number six position.
5. The highest grossing product line across all branches is the food and beverages product line.
6. Port Harcourt registered the highest gross income followed by Lagos and Abuja. However, Lagos sold more products overall.
7. Lagos and PortHarcourt recorded more sales in month one while Abuja sold more in month two.

# Future Work

In the future I will like to have a breakdown of the product lines so as to find which products excelled and which ones did not.

# Standout Section

I looked closely at the data provided and discovered that there is not much statistical differences in most of the columns. However, it is important to note that upon review of the ratings section, something appears to be outstanding.
1. 60% of the highest rating point of 10 were from normal customers and 80% of them were female.
2. 64% of the lowest ratings were from members and 55% were female.
3. Observed that month one is the highest performing month for Branch A and C, while the Branch B excelled in month two.

The question arises, why are more members disatisfied with items purchased from the stores? And why are the normal shoppers happy with the items? Again why do some stores perform better in certain months. A study should be conducted to find out why this is so.

# Executive Summary.

The data provided shows that the stores and the locations are about per in sales performance and income earned. The questions asked will center on ways to improve the performance of each store. We would recommend that each store include addresses of the customers and inventory positions per day to help monitor if the sales of certain items were infuenced by the stock balances.
